Implementing a rigorous phone number formatting and parsing library was crucial for the phone OS overall usability (back then, in the early 2000s, it was originally meant to be a phone after all, not just a SnapChat device).\n\n`libphonenumber-js` is a simplified pure javascript port of the original `libphonenumber` library (written in C++ and Java because those are the programming languages used in Android OS). While `libphonenumber` has an [official javascript port](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/tree/master/javascript) which is being maintained by Google, it is tightly coupled to Google's `closure` javascript utility framework. It still can be compiled into [one big bundle](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18678031/how-to-host-the-google-libphonenumber-locally/) which weighs 220 KiloBytes — quite a size for a phone number input component. It [can be reduced](https://github.com/leodido/i18n.phonenumbers.js) to a specific set of countries only but that wouldn't be an option for a worldwide international solution.\n\nOne part of me was curious about how all this phone matching machinery worked, and another part of me was curious if there's a way to reduce those 220 KiloBytes to something more reasonable while also getting rid of the `closure` library and rewriting it all in pure javascript. So, that was my little hackathon for a couple of weeks, and seems that it succeeded. The resulting library does everything a modern web application needs while maintaining a much smaller size of about 75 KiloBytes.\n\n## Difference from Google's `libphonenumber`\n\n  * Pure javascript, doesn't require any 3rd party libraries\n  * Metadata size is just about 75 KiloBytes while the original `libphonenumber` metadata size is about 200 KiloBytes\n  * Better \"as you type\" formatting (and also more iPhone-alike style)\n  * Doesn't parse alphabetic phone numbers like `1-800-GOT-MILK` as we don't use telephone sets in the XXIst century that much (and we have phonebooks in your mobile phones)\n  * Doesn't handle carrier codes: they're only used in Colombia and Brazil, and only when dialing within those countries from a mobile phone to a fixed line number (the locals surely already know those carrier codes by themselves)\n  * Assumes all phone numbers being `format`ted are internationally diallable, because that's the only type of phone numbers users are supposed to be inputting on websites (no one inputs short codes, emergency telephone numbers like `911`, etc.)\n  * Doesn't parse phone numbers with extensions (again, this is not the type of phone numbers users should input on websites — they're supposed to input their personal mobile phone numbers, or home stationary phone numbers if they're living in an area where celltowers don't have a good signal, not their business/enterprise stationary phone numbers)\n  * Doesn't use `possibleDigits` data to speed up phone number pre-validation (it just skips to the regular expression check itself)\n  * Doesn't distinguish between fixed line, mobile, pager, voicemail, toll free and other XXth century bullsh*t\n  * Doesn't format phone numbers for \"out of country dialing\", e.g. `011 ...` in the US (again, just use the `+...` notation accepted worldwide for mobile phones)\n  * Doesn't parse `tel:...` URIs ([RFC 3966](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3966.txt)) because it's not relevant for user-facing web experience\n  * When formatting international numbers replaces all braces, dashes, etc with spaces (because that's the logical thing to do, and leaving braces in an international number isn't)\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install libphonenumber-js --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport { parse, format, asYouType } from 'libphonenumber-js'\n\nparse('8 (800) 555 35 35', 'RU')\n// { country: 'RU', phone: '8005553535' }\n\nformat('2133734253', 'US', 'International')\n// '+1-213-373-4253'\n\nnew asYouType().input('+12133734')\n// '+1 213 373 4'\nnew asYouType('US').input('2133734')\n// '(213) 373-4'\n```\n\n## Country code definition\n\n\"Country code\" means either a [two-letter ISO country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) (like `US`) or a special `001` country code used for non-geographical entities (as per [Google's libphonenumber library](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/0068d861a68d3d4612f7bf8646ab844dd3cefce5/java/libphonenumber/test/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/RegionCode.java#L23-L24)). For example, `+7 800 555 35 35` phone number belongs to Russia so it has `RU` country code where as `+800 1 1111 1111` phone number could belong to any country so it has `001` country code.\n\n## API\n\n### parse(text, options)\n\n`options` can be either an object\n\n```js\ncountry:\n{\n  restrict — (country code)\n             the phone number must be in this country\n\n  default — (country code)\n            default country to use for phone number parsing and validation\n            (if no country code could be derived from the phone number)\n}\n```\n\nor just a [country code](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/libphonenumber-js#country-code-definition) which is gonna be `country.restrict`.\n\nReturns `{ country, phone }` where\n * `country` is a [country code](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/libphonenumber-js#country-code-definition)\n * `phone` is a national (significant) number\n\nIf the phone number supplied isn't valid then an empty object `{}` is returned.\n\n```js\nparse('+1-213-373-4253') === { country: 'US', phone: '2133734253' }\nparse('(213) 373-4253', 'US') === { country: 'US', phone: '2133734253' }\n```\n\n### format(parsed_number, format)\n\nFormats a phone number using one of the following `format`s:\n  * `International` — e.g. `+1 213 373 4253`\n  * `International_plaintext` — (aka [`E.164`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)) e.g. `+12133734253`\n  * `National` — e.g. `(213) 373-4253`\n\n`parsed_number` argument should be taken from the result of the `parse()` function call: `{ country, phone }`. `phone` must be a national (significant) number (i.e. no national prefix). `parsed_number` argument can also be expanded into two arguments:\n\n```js\nformat({ country: 'US', phone: '2133734253' }, 'International') === '+1 213 373 4253'\nformat('2133734253', 'US', 'International') === '+1 213 373 4253'\n```\n\n### getNumberType(parsed_number)\n\nDetermines phone number type (fixed line, mobile, toll free, etc). This function will work if `--extended` metadata is available (see [Metadata](#metadata) section of this document). The regular expressions used to differentiate between various phone number types consume a lot of space (two thirds of the total size of the `--extended` library build) therefore they're not included in the bundle by default.\n\nThe arguments can be\n\n * either the result of the `parse()` function call: `{ country, phone }`\n * or a pair of arguments `(phone, country_code)` in which case it is passed to the `parse()` function right away and the resulting `{ country, phone }` object is used\n\n```js\ngetNumberType('8005553535', 'RU') === 'MOBILE'\n```\n\n### isValidNumber(parsed_number)\n\n(aka `is_valid_number`)\n\nChecks if a phone number is valid.\n\nThe arguments can be\n\n * either the result of the `parse()` function call: `{ country, phone }`\n * or a pair of arguments `(phone, country_code)` in which case it is passed to the `parse()` function right away and the resulting `{ country, phone }` object is used\n\n```js\nisValidNumber('+1-213-373-4253') === true\nisValidNumber('+1-213-373') === false\n\nisValidNumber('(213) 373-4253', 'US') === true\nisValidNumber('(213) 37', 'US') === false\n\nisValidNumber({ phone: '2133734253', country: 'US' }) === true\n```\n\nThe difference between using `parse()` and `isValidNumber()` for phone number validation is that `isValidNumber()` also checks the precise regular expressions of possible phone numbers for a country. For example, for Germany `parse('123456', 'DE')` would return `{ country: 'DE', phone: '123456' }` because this phone number matches the general phone number rules for Germany. But, if the metadata is compiled with `--extended` flag (see below) and the precise regular expressions for possible phone numbers are included in the metadata then `isValidNumber()` is gonna use those precise regular expressions for validation and `isValid('123456', 'DE')` will return `false` because the phone number `123456` doesn't actually exist in Germany.\n\nSo, the general phone number rules for a country are mainly for phone number formatting: they dictate how different phone numbers (matching those general regular expressions) should be formatted. And `parse()` uses only those general regular expressions (as per the reference Google's `libphonenumber` implementation) to perform basic phone number validation. `isValidNumber()`, on the other hand, is all about validation, so it digs deeper into precise regular expressions (if they're included in metadata) for possible phone numbers in a given country. And that's the difference between them: `parse()` parses phone numbers and loosely validates them while `isValidNumber()` validates phone number precisely (provided the precise regular expressions are included in metadata).\n\nBy default those precise regular expressions aren't included in metadata at all because that would cause metadata to grow twice in its size (the complete metadata would be about 200 KiloBytes). If anyone needs to generate custom metadata then it's very easy to do so: just follow the instructions provided in the [Customizing metadata](#customizing-metadata) section of this document (the option to look for is `--extended`).\n\n### `class` asYouType(default_country_code)\n\n(aka `as_you_type`)\n\nCreates a formatter for partially entered phone number. The two-letter `default_country_code` is optional and, if specified, is gonna be the default country for the phone number being input (in case it's not an international one). The instance of this class has two methods:\n\n * `input(text)` — takes any text and appends it to the input; returns the formatted phone number\n * `reset()` — resets the input\n\nThe instance of this class has also these fields:\n\n<!-- * `valid` — is the phone number being input a valid one already\nformatter.valid === true -->\n * `country` — a [country code](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/libphonenumber-js#country-code-definition) of the country this phone belongs to\n * `country_phone_code` — a phone code of the `country`\n * `national_number` — national number part (so far)\n * `template` — currently used phone number formatting template, where digits (and the plus sign, if present) are denoted by `x`-es\n\n```js\nnew asYouType().input('+12133734') === '+1 213 373 4'\nnew asYouType('US').input('2133734') === '(213) 373-4'\n\nconst formatter = new asYouType()\nformatter.input('+1-213-373-4253') === '+1 213 373 4253'\nformatter.country === 'US'\nformatter.country_phone_code = '1'\nformatter.template === 'xx xxx xxx xxxx'\n```\n\n### getPhoneCode(country_code)\n\nThere have been requests for a function returning a phone code by country code.\n\n```js\ngetPhoneCode('RU') === '7'\ngetPhoneCode('IL') === '972'\n```\n\n## Metadata\n\nMetadata is generated from Google's original [`PhoneNumberMetadata.xml`](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/resources/PhoneNumberMetadata.xml) by transforming XML into JSON and removing unnecessary fields.\n\nCurrently I have an npm script for monitoring changes to `PhoneNumberMetadata.xml` in Google's repo and automatically creating a Pull Request in this repo with the fresh metadata when it is updated. What's left is to test this script and schedule it to run daily on my machine. So this project's metadata is supposed to be up-to-date. Still, in case the automatic metadata update script malfunctions some day, anyone can request metadata update via a Pull Request here on GitHub:\n\n  * Fork this repo\n  * `npm install`\n  * `npm run metadata:update`\n  * Submit a Pull Request to this repo from the `update-metadata` branch of your fork\n\n`npm run metadata:update` command creates a new `update-metadata` branch, downloads the new [`PhoneNumberMetadata.xml`](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/resources/PhoneNumberMetadata.xml) into the project folder replacing the old one, generates JSON metadata out of the XML one, checks if the metadata has changed, runs the tests, commits the new metadata and pushes the commit to the remote `update-metadata` branch of your fork.\n\nAlternatively, a developer may wish to update metadata urgently, without waiting for a pull request approval. In this case just perform the steps described in the [Customizing metadata](#customizing-metadata) section of this document.\n\n## React\n\nThere's also a React component utilizing this library: [`react-phone-number-input`](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/react-phone-number-input)\n\n<!-- ## To do\n\nEverything's done -->\n\n## Bug reporting\n\nIf any inconsistencies with the [original Google's `libphonenumber`](https://libphonenumber.appspot.com/) are spot then an issue can be created in this repo. Validation bugs should be reported only if they appear after full metadata is generated because with the default metadata the validation of this library is looser than the original Google `libphonenumber`'s.\n\n## Webpack\n\nIf you're using Webpack 1 (which you most likely are) then make sure that\n\n * You have `json-loader` set up for `*.json` files in Webpack configuration (Webpack 2 has `json-loader` set up by default)\n * `json-loader` doesn't `exclude` `/node_modules/`\n * If you override `resolve.extensions` in Webpack configuration then make sure `.json` extension is present in the list\n\nWebpack 2 sets up `json-loader` by default so there's no need for any special configuration. So better upgrade to Webpack 2 instead.\n\n## Standalone\n\nFor those who aren't using bundlers for some reason there's a way to build a standalone version of the library\n\n * `git clone https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/libphonenumber-js.git`\n * `npm install`\n * `npm run browser-build`\n * See the `bundle` folder for `libphonenumber-js.min.js`\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/scripts/libphonenumber-js.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  alert(new libphonenumber.asYouType('US').input('213-373-4253'))\n</script>\n```\n\n## Customizing metadata\n\nIf only a specific set of countries is needed in a project, and a developer really wants to reduce the resulting bundle size, say, by 50 KiloBytes, then he can generate custom metadata and pass it as an extra argument to this library's functions. Or, say, if a developer wants to use the complete metadata (which is about 200 KiloBytes) for precise phone number validation then he can also generate such complete metadata set.\n\nFirst, add metadata generation script to **your project's** `package.json`\n\n```js\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"libphonenumber-metadata\": \"libphonenumber-generate-metadata metadata.min.json --countries RU,DE --extended\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then run it like `npm run libphonenumber-metadata`.\n\nThe first argument is the output metadata file path. `--countries` argument is a comma-separated list of the required countries (if `--countries` is omitted then all countries are included). `--extended` argument may be passed to increase the precision of phone number validation but at the same time it will enlarge the resulting metadata size approximately twice.\n\nThen use the generated `metadata.min.json` with the exported \"custom\" functions.\n\nFor a \"tree-shaking\" ES6-capable bundler (e.g. Webpack 2) that would be\n\n```js\nimport { parseCustom, formatCustom, isValidNumberCustom, asYouTypeCustom } from 'libphonenumber-js'\nimport metadata from './metadata.min.json'\n\nexport const parse = (...args) => parseCustom(...args, metadata)\nexport const format = (...args) => formatCustom(...args, metadata)\nexport const isValidNumber = (...args) => isValidNumberCustom(...args, metadata)\n\nexport class asYouType extends asYouTypeCustom {\n  constructor(country) {\n    super(country, metadata)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd for [Common.js](https://auth0.com/blog/javascript-module-systems-showdown/) environment that would be\n\n```js\nvar custom = require('libphonenumber-js/custom')\nvar metadata = require('./metadata.min.json')\n\nexports.parse = function parse() {\n  var parameters = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)\n  parameters.push(metadata)\n  return custom.parse.apply(this, parameters)\n}\n\nexports.format = function format() {\n  var parameters = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)\n  parameters.push(metadata)\n  return custom.format.apply(this, parameters)\n}\n\nexports.isValidNumber = function isValidNumber() {\n  var parameters = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)\n  parameters.push(metadata)\n  return custom.isValidNumber.apply(this, parameters)\n}\n\nexports.asYouType = function asYouType(country) {\n  custom.asYouType.call(this, country, metadata)\n}\n\nexports.asYouType.prototype = Object.create(custom.asYouType.prototype, {})\nexports.asYouType.prototype.constructor = exports.asYouType\n\n```\n\nES6 \"tree-shaking\" is a non-trivial thing and at the moment of writing it's not guaranteed that a given ES6-aware bundler will actually be intelligent enough to tree-shake unused code, so there's always another option for those cases (if they arise): using `libphonenumber-js/custom` [Common.js](https://auth0.com/blog/javascript-module-systems-showdown/) export.\n\n```js\nimport { parse as parseCustom } from 'libphonenumber-js/custom'\nimport metadata from './metadata.min.json'\n\nexport const parse = (...args) => parseCustom(...args, metadata)\n```\n\n<!-- ## To do -->\n\n<!--\n## Automatic metadata update setup\n\nA daily (24 * 60 * 60) `launchd` job\n\nhttp://alvinalexander.com/mac-os-x/mac-osx-startup-crontab-launchd-jobs\n\n```sh\nmkdir /Users/kuchumovn/work/libphonenumber-js-autoupdate\n\ngit clone https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/libphonenumber-js.git /Users/kuchumovn/work/libphonenumber-js-autoupdate\n\ncd /Users/kuchumovn/work/libphonenumber-js-autoupdate\n\nnpm install\n\nchmod u+x /Users/kuchumovn/work/libphonenumber-js-autoupdate/autoupdate.sh\n\nnano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.halt-hammerzeit.libphonenumber-js.metadata-update.plist\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.github.halt-hammerzeit.libphonenumber-js.metadata-update</string>\n\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>/Users/kuchumovn/work/libphonenumber-js-autoupdate/autoupdate.sh</string>\n    </array>\n\n    <key>Nice</key>\n    <integer>1</integer>\n\n    <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>86400</integer>\n\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/libphonenumber.errors.txt</string>\n\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/libphonenumber.output.txt</string>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.halt-hammerzeit.libphonenumber-js.metadata-update.plist\n\nlaunchctl list | grep 'libphonenumber-js'\n```\n-->\n\n## Contributing\n\nAfter cloning this repo, ensure dependencies are installed by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis module is written in ES6 and uses [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for ES5\ntranspilation. Widely consumable JavaScript can be produced by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\nOnce `npm run build` has run, you may `import` or `require()` directly from\nnode.\n\nAfter developing, the full test suite can be evaluated by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nWhen you're ready to test your new functionality on a real project, you can run\n\n```sh\nnpm pack\n```\n\nIt will `build`, `test` and then create a `.tgz` archive which you can then install in your project folder\n\n```sh\nnpm install [module name with version].tar.gz\n```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n",
